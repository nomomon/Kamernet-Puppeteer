# Kamernet Puppeteer
In Netherlands universities are not obliged to provide housing for students. However, they do provide services through which students may find a room. But they are either fully booked, or not in good shape.

Kamernet is a platform where people can find home. When I began using it, I quickly understood that it is not me who chooses my home, but the home (landlord) chooses me.

So, the most obvious solution was to write a message to every home and hope that they invite me to a viewing.
