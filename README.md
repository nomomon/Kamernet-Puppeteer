# Kamernet Puppeteer
Netherland universities do not provide accommodation, but help international students in their search. They provide services like SSH, funda, Paprius, ROOM, ...

Kamernet is a platform where people can find home. When I began using it, I quickly understood that it is very competetive and it's not me who chooses a home, but a home (landlord) chooses me.

Many have said that they are looking for dutch students, or that I am arriving too late and they need people now, or they say that there was a guy before who replied one of the first.

So, the most obvious solution was to write a message to every home and hope that they invite me to a viewing.
