# How to find a room in Netherlands?

Hi! Unfortunately we have had an enormous amount of interest in the room that has forced us to put a stop to new applicants. We are very sorry for this. To put this into numbers: we had 10 applications within the first 5 minutes of the post coming online. Currently we have over 67 applicants.

It is nothing personal, but we simply cannot give everyone the time and attention that they need to have an honest chance.

I wish you the best of luck in finding a room in Groningen. It can be very challenging, but eventually everyone will find something.

- make sure that you adres the correct person. When copy-pasting many applications this can happen.
- don't tell too much or too little about yourself. keep it between 100-200 words.
- be honest
- make minor tweaks to the story to adjust it to the specific application, this lets the owner of the page know that you actually read the advertisement and not just blindly spam every room. - - Everyone blindly spams everything so make sure that you stand out.
- Although a very valid question, do not ask 'is the room still available' at first contact. copy paste your story and THEN ask whether it is still available.
- If possible, pick a date or a few days in which you plan viewings. Book a hotel and visit some homes. --&gt; 'I am starting in september, but I'll be in Groningen from July 24-26 so we can have a viewing then.' obviously this only applies to people who within a 500 km circle.
- Yes, you do have a bigger change if you are physically here.
- Yes it is hard to find a room. But you will.
