# How to find a room in Netherlands?

Hi! It may be hard to find a room in Netherlands as a student (especialy not from EU, believe me, I went through it). This guide is composed of advice given to by the landlords themselfes. I wish you the best of luck in finding a room in Groningen. It can be very challenging, but eventually everyone will find something.

## Why using this code is a bad idea?
and why is a bad idea to use Kamernet?

- A good portion of all the listing is for women or Dutch only, so if you don't fit in this category it is will be harder.
- Kamernet has [unrealistic requirments](https://kamernet.force.com/support/s/article/room-guarantee2?language=en_US&fbclid=IwAR0oQBWLHCbkAkhZxguIEo_rQxDRwWK0cT960acyRedSfUiFS-9z0MdfAuA) for refund.
- This code (if default settings used) sends a message within first 10 minutes of advert publication. Your message may get buried under messages from others.

## Competition
Competition is rough. Every year there are hundreds of freshman looking for rooms, and there are students in their second and third years who might be also looking for rooms. This is what one landlord replied:

> Hi! Unfortunately we have had an enormous amount of interest in the room that has forced us to put a stop to new applicants. We are very sorry for this. To put this into numbers: we had 10 applications within the first 5 minutes of the post coming online. Currently we have over 67 applicants.


## Message

Recommendations on writing your message:

- Make sure that you address the correct person. When copy-pasting many applications miss naming can happen.
- Don't tell too much or too little about yourself. Keep it between 100-200 words.
- Be honest.
- Make minor tweaks to the story to adjust it to the specific application, this lets the owner of the page know that you actually read the advertisement and not just **blindly spam every room**. 
    - Everyone blindly spams everything, so make sure that you stand out.
- Although a very valid question, do not ask `'is the room still available?'` at first contact. Copy paste your story and THEN ask whether it is still available.
- If possible, pick a date or a few days in which you plan viewings. Book a hotel and visit some homes. Then, in your message you can write `'I am starting my education in September, but I'll be in Groningen from July 24-26 so we can have a viewing then.'` (Obviously this only applies to people who are within a 500 km circle.)

Yes, you do have a bigger change if you are physically here.
Yes, *it is hard* to find a room, but *you will*.
